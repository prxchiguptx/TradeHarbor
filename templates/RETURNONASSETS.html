  <h1><u>RETURN ON ASSETS (%)</u></h1> <!-- Heading in the middle -->
  <h2>"Return on Assets (ROA) %" is a financial metric that measures a company's profitability relative to its total assets. 
Return: Return refers to the profit or earnings generated by the company.<br>
Assets: Assets represent all the resources owned or controlled by the company that have economic value. This can include cash, inventory, property, equipment, and investments.
Now, the Return on Assets (ROA) % is like calculating how much profit the company is making for every rupee of assets it owns. It's calculated by dividing the net profit by the total assets and then expressing the result as a percentage.<br><br>
Formula -> ROA (%) =  NetProfit / Total Assets * 100<br><br>
For example, if a company has a net profit of Rs. 100,000 and total assets of Rs. 1,000,000, the ROA would be 10% (Rs. 100,000 / Rs. 1,000,000 * 100). This means that for every rupee of assets owned by the company, it generates a profit of 10 paise. The ROA % helps investors and analysts assess how efficiently the company is using its assets to generate profits. A higher ROA % indicates that the company is generating more profit for each rupee of assets owned, which is generally considered favorable.
