  <h1><u>INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO</u></h1> <!-- Heading in the middle -->
  <h2>"Interest Coverage Ratio" is a financial metric that measures a company's ability to cover its interest expenses with its operating income. 
Interest Expenses: Interest expenses refer to the money a company pays in interest on its debts, such as loans or bonds. It's like the interest you might pay on a loan you took to buy a toy or a bicycle.<br><br>
Operating Income: Operating income is the profit a company earns from its core business operations before deducting interest and taxes. It represents the money the company makes from selling its products or services, minus the cost of goods sold and operating expenses.<br><br>
Now, the Interest Coverage Ratio is like comparing the amount of money the company makes from its operations to the amount of money it needs to pay in interest expenses. It's calculated by dividing the company's operating income by its interest expenses. <br><br>
Formula -> Interest Coverage Ratio = Operating Income / Interest Expenses<br><br>
For example, if a company has an operating income of Rs. 500,000 and interest expenses of Rs. 100,000, the interest coverage ratio would be 5 (Rs. 500,000 / Rs. 100,000). This means that the company's operating income is sufficient to cover its interest expenses 5 times over.<br><br>
The Interest Coverage Ratio helps investors and creditors assess the company's ability to meet its interest obligations. A higher ratio indicates that the company is more capable of servicing its debt, which is generally considered favorable.
