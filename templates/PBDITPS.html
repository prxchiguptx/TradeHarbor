PBDIT is a measure of a company's profitability before deducting certain expenses such as depreciation, interest on loans, and taxes. It represents the profit generated by a company's core business operations.
Per Share: "Per Share" simply means the value of a particular financial metric divided by the total number of outstanding shares of a company. It helps standardize the financial metric on a per-share basis, making it easier for investors to compare across different companies, regardless of their size. So, PBDIT per Share tells investors how much profit a company has generated from its core operations on a per-share basis. It gives insight into the profitability of each share of the company's stock and helps investors assess the company's performance relative to its market price per share.
