  <h1><u>VOLATILITY RATIO</u></h1> <!-- Heading in the middle -->
  <h2>"Volatility Ratio" typically refers to a financial metric that measures the level of volatility or price fluctuations of a stock or an index over a specific period.
Volatility: Volatility refers to the degree of variation or fluctuation in the price of a financial instrument, such as a stock or an index. High volatility means that the price of the instrument can change rapidly and by significant amounts, while low volatility means that the price changes are relatively stable and less dramatic.
Volatility Ratio: The Volatility Ratio is a ratio that quantifies the level of volatility in relation to some benchmark or reference point. This ratio can be calculated using various methods, such as comparing the standard deviation of the stock's or index's returns to its average return, or by comparing its trading range to its average price.
The Volatility Ratio helps investors and traders gauge the risk associated with a particular stock or index. A higher Volatility Ratio indicates higher volatility and greater risk, while a lower ratio suggests lower volatility and lower risk. Investors and traders often use volatility measures to assess potential price movements and adjust their investment or trading strategies accordingly.
