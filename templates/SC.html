  <h1><u>SHARE CAPITAL</u></h1> <!-- Heading in the middle -->
  <h2>"Share Capital" is like the initial amount of money that a company collects from investors in exchange for issuing shares. Imagine you have a big jar where you collect money from your friends to start a new club. Each friend gives you some money in exchange for a membership share in the club. The total amount of money you collect from all your friends is like the share capital of your club. Similarly, in the stock market, when a company wants to raise money to fund its operations or expand its business, it can issue shares to investors. The money that the company receives from selling these shares is called share capital. It's like the initial funds that the company has to work with. For example, if a company issues 1,000 shares at Rs. 100 each, the total share capital would be Rs. 1,00,000 (1,000 shares * Rs. 100). This money becomes part of the company's capital structure and can be used for various purposes like buying equipment, hiring employees, or investing in growth opportunities.
