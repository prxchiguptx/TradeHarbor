  <h1><u>DIVIDEND PAYOUT RATIO</u></h1> <!-- Heading in the middle -->
  <h2>"Dividend Payout Ratio" is a financial metric that measures the percentage of earnings distributed to shareholders in the form of dividends. 
Earnings: Earnings refer to the profits or net income generated by a company from its business operations.
Dividends: Dividends are payments made by a company to its shareholders as a distribution of profits. It's like sharing a portion of the money the company has earned with its owners (shareholders).<br><br>
Now, the Dividend Payout Ratio is like calculating how much of the company's earnings are being paid out to shareholders as dividends. It's calculated by dividing the total dividends paid by the company by its total earnings and then expressing the result as a percentage.<br><br>
Formula -> Dividend Payout Ratio (%) = Total Dividends / Total Earnings * 100<br><br>
For example, if a company has total earnings of Rs. 1,000,000 and pays out Rs. 200,000 in dividends, the dividend payout ratio would be 20% (Rs. 200,000 / Rs. 1,000,000 * 100). This means that the company is distributing 20% of its earnings to shareholders as dividends. The Dividend Payout Ratio helps investors assess how much of a company's earnings are being returned to shareholders as dividends. A higher ratio indicates that the company is distributing a larger portion of its profits to shareholders, which can be attractive to income-oriented investors seeking regular dividend income.
