  <h2>"Return on Equity (ROE) %" is a financial metric that measures the profitability of a company in relation to its shareholders' equity. 
Return: Return refers to the profit or earnings generated by the company.
Equity: Equity represents the shareholders' ownership interest in the company. It includes the initial capital invested by shareholders and retained earnings (profits that have not been distributed as dividends).
Now, the Return on Equity (ROE) % is like calculating how much profit the company is making for every rupee of equity invested by its shareholders. It's calculated by dividing the net profit by the shareholders' equity and then expressing the result as a percentage.<br><br>
Formula -> ROE (%)  = Net Profit / Shareholders’ Equity  * 100<br><br>
In the Indian stock market, "Return on Equity (ROE) %" is a financial metric that measures the profitability of a company in relation to its shareholders' equity. Let's break it down:
Return:
Return refers to the profit or earnings generated by the company.
Equity:
Equity represents the shareholders' ownership interest in the company. It includes the initial capital invested by shareholders and retained earnings (profits that have not been distributed as dividends).<br>
Now, the Return on Equity (ROE) % is like calculating how much profit the company is making for every rupee of equity invested by its shareholders. It's calculated by dividing the net profit by the shareholders' equity and then expressing the result as a percentage.
Here's the formula:<br><br>
ROE (%)=Net Profit /Shareholders’ Equity×100
<br><br>For example, if a company has a net profit of Rs. 100,000 and shareholders' equity of Rs. 1,000,000, the ROE would be 10% (Rs. 100,000 / Rs. 1,000,000 * 100). This means that for every rupee of equity invested by shareholders, the company generates a profit of 10 paise. The ROE % helps investors and analysts assess how efficiently the company is using its equity to generate profits. A higher ROE % indicates that the company is generating more profit for each rupee of equity invested, which is generally considered favorable.
