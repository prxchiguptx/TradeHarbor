  <h1><u>Number Of Shares</u></h1> <!-- Heading in the middle -->
  <h2>The number of shares of a company represents the total number of ownership units of that company's stock held by investors. <br>
<br>
Total Shares Outstanding: If you want to calculate the total number of shares outstanding for a company, you would typically find this information on the company's financial statements or in financial databases. The formula is:<br>

Total Shares Outstanding = Total Equity / Share Price
<br>
Where:<br>

Total Equity: The total value of the company's equity (sometimes called market capitalization).<br>
Share Price: The price of one share of the company's stock.
Shares Owned by an Investor: If you want to calculate the number of shares owned by a specific investor, you would typically need to know the percentage of ownership or the number of shares they hold. The formula is:<br>

Shares Owned = Total Shares Outstanding * Ownership Percentage<br>

Or, if you know the actual number of shares:<br>

Shares Owned = Number of Shares Held<br>

Fractional Shares: In some cases, investors may hold fractional shares, especially if they participate in dividend reinvestment programs (DRIPs) or have bought partial shares through certain investment platforms. The formula for calculating the value of fractional shares is:<br>

Value of Fractional Shares = Fractional Share Percentage * Share Price<br>

Where:<br>

Fractional Share Percentage: The percentage of a whole share held by the investor.
Share Price: The price of one share of the company's stock.
