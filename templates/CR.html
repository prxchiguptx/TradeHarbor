  <h1><u>CURRENT RATIO</u></h1> <!-- Heading in the middle -->
  <h2>"Current Ratio" is a financial metric used to evaluate a company's liquidity and ability to meet short-term financial obligations. Imagine you have a jar of marbles representing all the money a company has, and you have two bowls representing its current assets and current liabilities.
Current Assets: These are the marbles in one of the bowls, representing all the assets that the company expects to convert into cash or use up within one year. This can include cash, inventory, accounts receivable (money owed by customers), and other assets.
Current Liabilities: These are the marbles in the other bowl, representing all the company's obligations that are due within one year. This can include accounts payable (money owed to suppliers), short-term loans, and other liabilities.
Now, the Current Ratio is like comparing the number of marbles in the current assets bowl to the number of marbles in the current liabilities bowl. It's calculated by dividing the total current assets by the total current liabilities.</h2><br><br><H1>CURRENT RATO FORMULA= CURRENT ASSET/ CURRENT LIABILITY</H1>

<h2>If a company has Rs. 500,000 in current assets and Rs. 250,000 in current liabilities, the current ratio would be 2 (Rs. 500,000 / Rs. 250,000). This means the company has twice as many current assets as current liabilities, indicating a healthy liquidity position.
The Current Ratio helps investors and analysts assess whether a company has enough short-term assets to cover its short-term liabilities. A ratio of 2 or higher is generally considered healthy, as it suggests the company has enough assets to meet its short-term obligations. However, a very high ratio may indicate that the company is not efficiently using its assets, while a low ratio may suggest liquidity problems.
